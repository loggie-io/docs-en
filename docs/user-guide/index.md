# User Guide
In this USER GUIDE section, we mainly introduce the main functions and features of Loggie, and show how to use Loggie to meet various needs in various scenarios.

If you want to inquire about the usage and configuration of specific components, please click [Configuration](../reference/index.md).

## What problems will be encountered when implementing a log system?
In the enterprise, how do we build a complete log system? How to choose according to the actual situation, and what problems will be encountered?
Under different business types, different usage scenarios, and different log scales, what log system architectures can we adopt?

Please refer to [Enterprise Pracitice](enterprise-practice/architecture-and-evolution.md).

After we have a preliminary understanding of the implementation of a log system with complete functions and complete architecture, we want to know:

## Why can Loggie solve these problems?
There are already many open source log collection agents on the market. Why did we choose to develop Loggie?
What problem was Loggie born to solve?  
What is the difference between Loggie and other open source log agents?  

Refer to [Architecture and Features](architecture/background.md).

## How to use Loggie to solve these problems?
How to use Loggie in Kubernetes?  
Refer to [Kubernetes](use-in-kubernetes/general-usage.md).
  
How can I configure various log collecting architectures? How to adapt Loggie to existing services? How to deal with log processing and segmentation? What other useful functions does Loggie provide?
Refer to [Best Practice](best-practice/log-enrich.md).

How to configure the overall monitoring and alarm to ensure the normal operation of Loggie? How to monitor whether ERROR logs are collected?
Refer to [Monitor and Alerm](monitor/loggie-monitor.md).
