## Benchmarks and Comparisons

**Test Environment:**

- Physical machine 48C, 256G
- Kafka 3 Broker, mount SSD disk
- Filebeat v7.8 version, no processor configured; Loggie includes cost, retry, metric interceptor by default;

**Test Purposes:**

Performance comparison between Filebeat and Loggie

**Test Idea:**

Both Filebeat and Loggie collect logs and send them to Kafka. Observe the corresponding resource usage and sending throughput.

**Test Details:**

Automatically generate 5,000,000 lines of logs in a single file. The content of each line is as follows:

```

```

Configure Filebeat and Loggie to collect logs and send them to a topic in Kafka without client-side compression. The Kafka topic is configured with Partition 3.

In the case of ensuring sufficient resources of the Agent, modify the number of files collected, the concurrency of the sending client (configure Filebeat worker and Loggie parallelism). Observe the sending rate of CPU, Memory, and Pod network.

The test got the following data:

| Agent    | Fize Size     | Number of Log Files | Sending Concurrency | CPU  | MEM (rss)        | NIC sending rate |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Filebeat | 3.2G     | 1          | 3          | 7.5~8.5c | 63.8MiB | 75.9MiB/s            |
| Filebeat | 3.2G     | 1          | 8          | 10c      | 65MiB   | 70MiB/s              |
| Filebeat | 3.2G     | 10         | 8          | 11c      | 65MiB   | 80MiB/s              |
|          |          |          |            |            |          |             |                     |
| Loggie   | 3.2G     | 1          | 3          | 2.1c     | 60MiB   | 120MiB/s             |
| Loggie   | 3.2G     | 1          | 8          | 2.4c     | 68.7MiB | 120MiB/s             |
| Loggie   | 3.2G     | 10         | 8          | 3.5c     | 70MiB   | 210MiB/s             |

**Test Conclusion:**

Under the same pressure test conditions and scenarios:

- The CPU consumption of Loggie is only about Â¼ of Filebeat, and the sending throughput is 1.6 to 2.6 times that of the Filebeat.

- Loggie and Filebeat have nearly same memory consumption. Both low.

- There is a bottleneck in the limit throughput of Filebeat, and it is difficult to increase after 80MB/s. Loggie can reach more than 200MiB/s.
